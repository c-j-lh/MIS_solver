Diversity loss, for each of M GNN models, compare to closest solution (how to with MCTS/RL though)
Then BFS, with queue f incomplete solutions

Add local search (manual optimisation) and graph reduction
Max clique and MVC directly (cos complementary graphs too dense)

Reading list:
Reinf Learning
MCTS
GNNS
Satisfiability & other NP-hard problems
Coursera with pytorch

Practice:
implement:
- minimax
- MCTS
- GNNs (from scratch)
- MCTS with GNNs

idk; improvements:
non-random random_sampling/simulation: what rules for MIS though?
different UCB function (e.g. Upper Confidence Bound 1: Q/N + c*sqrt(ln(N(a'))/N(a))?, and different weightings through different epochs?)
--      What other functions are there, though?
(what is alpha-beta pruning?)


# NEW (post-meeting)
Confusion: is multithreading slowing down my use_models so much, to 17s/iter and 100 iter being the limiting factor instead of time # maybe try at home?
Where have my output files gone? Probably not a server bug though # did I rm model/p200_0.pth AND log/p200_0.pickle? Seems unlikely... so I can only assume... ??
